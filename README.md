# Evaluating Embeddding Spaces for Pallet Re-Identification 

This project implements different approaches for embedding space generation. 
Different approaches are evaluated regarding the re-identification performance of pallet blocks based on their chipwood patterns.
Re-identification performance is measured in an open set, as well as a closed set scenario.
For further details please refer to the paper
